## Optical Fiber Simulations for my PhD Research

This repository contains Python code developed for my PhD research on optical fiber communications. The code simulates optical signal transmission through single-mode fibers using dual-polarization modulated lasers.

### Features:
- **Optical Signal Simulation:** Simulate transmission through optical fibers.
- **DSP Chain Evaluation:** Tools for analyzing the digital signal processing chain at the receiver.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Codes for incorporating neural networks in the receiver for signal equalization.

The simulation results have contributed to several scholarly articles.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.x and required libraries (NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
3. Follow the script headers for instructions on running simulations.

### Contributing
This repository has been maintained solely by me. Currently, no contributions are accepted.
