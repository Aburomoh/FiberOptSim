## Optical Fiber Simulations for my PhD Research

This repository contains Python code developed for my PhD research on optical fiber communications. The code simulates optical signal transmission through single-mode fibers using dual-polarization modulated lasers.

Here are descriptions of the files for your GitHub repository:

### README.md
- **Description:** The primary documentation file that provides an overview of the repository, instructions on how to use the files, and any other relevant information.

### dsys.py
- **Description:** Contains all the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions used throughout the project. This library is done in collaboration with my colleague Jamal Darweesh. I've got to give him credit where credit is due. :)

### WDM_signal_generation.py
- **Description:** This script should be run first as it generates the necessary data for subsequent analyses. It simulates the transmission and reception of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) signals across various power levels from -2 to 8 dBm. The output includes transmitted (Tx) and received (Rx) signals, symbols, and equalized signals at the receiver for each power level. Note: The script may take about 30 minutes per power level to complete.

### LDBP_code.py
- **Description:** The core script of the project, implementing Learned Digital Backpropagation (LDBP), a model-based neural network approach, along with traditional digital backpropagation (DBP) with different steps/span resolutions, and linear equalization (LE). This script compares the performance of these methods using the data generated by `WDM_signal_generation.py`. Ensure that the data generation script has completed before running this to avoid errors.

### Constellation_Rx_-2dBm.png
- **Description:** Visualization of the signal constellation at the receiver after all processing for a launch power of -2 dBm. This image helps in assessing the signal quality and the impact of the channel and DSP techniques.

### Spectrum.png
- **Description:** Shows the spectrum of a single channel at the receiver post-equalization.

### WDM_Spectrum_Rx.png
- **Description:** Shows the frequency domain spectrum of the WDM signal at the receiver.

### WDM_Spectrum_Tx.png
- **Description:** Shows the frequency domain spectrum of the WDM signal at the transmitter side.

### Features:
- **Optical Signal Simulation:** Simulate transmission through optical fibers.
- **DSP Chain Evaluation:** Tools for analyzing the digital signal processing chain at the receiver.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Codes for incorporating neural networks in the receiver for signal equalization.

The simulation results have contributed to several scholarly articles.
